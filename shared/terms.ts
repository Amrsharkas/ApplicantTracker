IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Plato online
platform, web applications, mobile applications, APIs, and related services (collectively,
the “Service”) in your capacity as an individual using the Service as a job applicant,
candidate, or prospective candidate (“Applicant”, “you”).

By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have
read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do
not agree, you must not use the Service.

ABOUT PLATO
1.1 Identity of the Provider
The Service is operated by Plato (“Plato”, “we”, “us”, “our”), a cloud-based hiring and
interview technology provider. Details about our registered entity, address, and contact
information are provided on our website and may vary by region.

1.2 Relationship with Employers
Plato provides tools that allow employers and other organizations (“Employers”) to manage
recruitment processes, including job postings, interviews, and assessments. Plato is not a
party to any employment contract that may be formed between you and an Employer and does
not act as your legal representative, recruiter, or employer.

ELIGIBILITY AND ACCOUNT CREATION
2.1 Eligibility
You may use the Service only if:
(a) you are at least the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, or you have valid
parental or guardian consent;

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.

2.2 Account Registration
To access certain features, you may be required to create an account and provide
information such as your name, email address, contact details, and password. You agree to:
(a) provide accurate, current, and complete information;
(b) maintain and promptly update such information to keep it accurate and complete; and
(c) keep your login credentials confidential and not share them with any other person.

You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or
not authorized by you. You must notify us promptly of any actual or suspected unauthorized
use of your account.

2.3 One Account per Individual
Unless explicitly permitted by Plato, you must not create more than one account as an
Applicant. We reserve the right to merge, suspend, or terminate duplicate accounts.

3.2 No Guarantee of Employment
You acknowledge that:

Plato;
(c) Employers may choose to close roles, pause hiring, or change criteria at any time,
with or without notice.

APPLICANT CONTENT AND LICENSE
4.1 Applicant Content
“Applicant Content” means any information or material you provide or generate through the
Service, including but not limited to:
(a) CVs, resumes, cover letters, portfolios;
(b) profile information, job preferences, skills, and experience;
(c) responses to assessments, questionnaires, and interview questions;
(d) audio or video recordings, transcripts, and written answers;
(e) communications sent through the Service.

You are responsible for ensuring that Applicant Content is accurate, lawful, and does not
violate the rights of any third party.

4.2 Ownership of Applicant Content
You retain all ownership rights in your Applicant Content, subject to the licenses you
grant to Plato and Employers as described in these Terms.

4.3 License to Plato (Service Operation)
By submitting Applicant Content, you grant Plato a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, reproduce, process, adapt,
translate, display, and use your Applicant Content for the following purposes:
(a) operating and providing the Service to you and to Employers to whom you apply or with
whom you interact through the Service;
(b) enabling Employers to evaluate your candidacy and communicate with you;
(c) maintaining, securing, and improving the Service; and
(d) complying with legal obligations and enforcing our rights.

4.4 License to Employers
When you apply to a job or otherwise interact with an Employer through the Service, you
authorize Plato to disclose relevant Applicant Content to that Employer. The Employer may

use that Applicant Content for legitimate recruitment, hiring, and HR-related purposes,
subject to the Employer’s own privacy and data protection obligations and policies.

Plato is not responsible for an Employer’s independent use of your Applicant Content once
it has been shared.

USE OF INTERVIEW AND ASSESSMENT DATA FOR AI TRAINING
5.1 Types of Data Used
To power and improve our AI and machine learning systems, we use “Interview and Assessment
Data”, which may include:
(a) your responses in interviews and assessments (text, audio, video, coding challenges,
etc.);
(b) transcripts and derived features (e.g., speech-to-text, sentiment, timing, structure);
(c) model-generated scores, ratings, and explanations;
(d) interaction metadata (e.g., time taken, device type, completion rates).

5.2 Purpose of Use
By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that Plato may use Interview and
Assessment Data to:
(a) train, test, evaluate, and improve current and future AI and machine learning models;
(b) develop new features, analytics, and tools to assist Applicants and Employers;
(c) perform benchmarking, research, and quality assurance on our systems.

5.3 De-Identification and Aggregation
Where reasonably possible and consistent with our legitimate interests, Plato will apply
techniques such as aggregation, pseudonymization, or de-identification so that Interview
and Assessment Data used for training models is not directly attributable to you as an
identified individual.

5.4 No Data Brokerage
Plato does not sell Interview and Assessment Data as a standalone dataset to data brokers.
We may, however, share aggregated or anonymized statistics that do not identify you
personally (for example, average completion times or generic performance distributions).

(e) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code of any part of the
Service;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF PLATO
9.1 Ownership
All rights, title, and interest in and to the Service (including its software, interfaces,
AI models, algorithms, designs, and documentation) are owned by Plato or its licensors.
These are protected by intellectual property and other laws.

9.2 Limited License
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Plato grants you a limited, non-exclusive,

commercial job-search and career development purposes.

You must not:
(a) copy, modify, or create derivative works of any part of the Service;
(b) use any automated means to access or scrape the Service, except as permitted by Plato;
(c) remove or obscure any proprietary notices or trademarks.

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
The Service may integrate or interoperate with third-party platforms (such as video
conferencing tools, code assessment systems, or communication providers). Your use of such
third-party services may be subject to their own terms and privacy policies. Plato is not
responsible for third-party services or their actions.

DISCLAIMERS
The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, Plato disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory,
including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, and reliability.

Without limiting the foregoing, we do not warrant that:
(a) the Service will meet your requirements or expectations;
(b) the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free;
(c) the results or scores provided by the Service will be accurate, complete, or
sufficient for any particular hiring or career decision.

Any reliance you place on outputs from the Service is at your own risk.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
(a) Plato will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, data, or opportunities
arising out of or relating to your use of the Service; and
(b) Plato’s total aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the Service and
these Terms will not exceed the greater of: (i) the amount you have paid to Plato (if any)
for Applicant-facing features in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to
the claim; or (ii) a fixed monetary amount [e.g., USD 100 or equivalent].

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of
these limitations may not apply to you.

INDEMNIFICATION
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Plato, its affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages,
losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:
