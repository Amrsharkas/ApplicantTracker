🎯 Goal:
After the user completes their profile and all three interviews, generate a final, public-facing profile that reflects exactly who the candidate is — based on facts, evidence, and interview answers, not on assumptions or unverified claims.


This profile will be visible to employers and must serve as a truthful, professional, and complete portrait of the user’s real capabilities, verified skills, work style, and experience.


🧠 Instructions for Profile Generation Logic:
✅ STEP 1: Merge All Data Sources
The system must analyze and extract content from the following:


The original profile inputs (education, skills, experience, preferences)


The Background Interview


The Professional Interview


The Technical Interview


All sections of the final profile must reflect information that was confirmed across these sources. Do not rely on the profile inputs alone.


📐 Profile Structure — What Must Be Included
1. Summary Overview (3–5 lines)
A factual summary of the user’s level, role type, industry focus, and communication or behavioral style.


Example:


“Entry-level software engineer with exposure to front-end frameworks and interest in startup environments. Calm communicator, prefers working with small agile teams.”


2. Verified Skills
A list of skills the system can confidently confirm based on interview answers + profile.


If a skill was listed in the profile but the candidate gave a weak, vague, or no example during interviews, flag it.


Example:


JavaScript – Verified


Team Leadership – Claimed but not demonstrated in interview


SQL – Demonstrated basic understanding


3. Interview Insights (Categorized Summaries)
Create short, honest summaries using interview responses. Use actual quotes only when meaningful.


Organize by category:


Background & Experience


Workplace Behavior & Preferences


Professional Communication


Technical Knowledge


For each:


Summarize what the user actually said


Be blunt if vague or uncertain answers were given


Avoid general praise


Example (Technical Knowledge):


“Candidate claimed experience with React but was unable to explain core concepts such as hooks or component lifecycle. Understanding appears surface-level.”


Example (Professional Behavior):


“Described managing two projects but struggled to describe how timelines or team roles were handled. Responses lacked clarity or detail.”


4. Strengths (Only If Proven)
List only strengths that were clearly demonstrated across interviews. Each must be tied to a real example or confident, detailed response.


Example:


Able to explain past mistakes with honesty and reflection


Shows preference for independent work, supported by 3 examples from past roles


5. Weaknesses or Gaps
Call out mismatches or areas where profile claims weren’t backed up.


Example:


“Although the candidate listed ‘advanced Excel’ on their profile, they were unable to explain key functions beyond basic formulas during the technical interview.”


Or:


“Said they enjoy leadership roles but expressed discomfort with delegation and team accountability.”


6. Work Preferences
Clearly state:


Preferred work mode (Remote, On-site, Hybrid)


Team vs. individual working style


Willingness to relocate


Stated career goals
These must be gathered from both the profile and interviews.


7. Language and Tone
Always professional


No optimism or unnecessary praise


No flattery (e.g., “You’re great at…”)


Be blunt, neutral, and fact-based


Use phrases like:


“Demonstrated ability to…”


“Unable to provide clear examples of…”


“Profile suggests…, but interview answers lacked…”


🚫 What to Avoid
Do not write generic strengths (e.g., “Hardworking,” “Team player”) unless proven in responses


Do not hide weak performance — explain it clearly


Do not assume anything that wasn’t explicitly said or demonstrated


✅ Final Check Before Display:
Before showing the final profile:


Has every claimed skill or trait in the profile been checked against interview performance?


Are all included strengths backed by real interview content?


Are weaknesses stated factually, not emotionally?


Is the profile clear, easy to scan, and free from false praise?
