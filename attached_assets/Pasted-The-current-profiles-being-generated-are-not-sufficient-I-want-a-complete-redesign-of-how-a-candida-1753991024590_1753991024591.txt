The current profiles being generated are not sufficient. I want a complete redesign of how a candidate’s profile is created after completing:

Their manually filled-out profile

The three AI interviews:

Background / Soft Skills

Professional / Experience

Technical / Problem Solving

🧩 The Profile Must Be:
Brutally honest — no sugarcoating or generic praise

Blunt and grounded in evidence — every claim must be backed by something the candidate actually said

Critical — even when a candidate shows strength, include a “but” to point out what’s still lacking or unclear

Structured and analyzable — no fluff, just clear sections and takeaways

Focused solely on the candidate side — do not reference employers or hiring decisions

📘 Profile Structure
1. Candidate Summary (Max 3–5 lines):
Write a short, honest overview of the person based on their answers and input. Do not repeat what they said — evaluate it. Example:

"Candidate presents as confident and experienced in frontend development, but failed to clearly support claims with examples or projects."

2. Key Strengths (Every strength must be followed by a “but”):
Example:

"Shows strong communication ability but lacked specificity when discussing team leadership challenges."
"Understands basic data analysis but couldn’t apply concepts to real-world problems when asked."

3. Weaknesses and Gaps:
Be direct. Highlight missing skills, vague or incorrect answers, inconsistencies, lack of proof, or overstatements.

4. Soft Skills Review (from Interview 1):
Critique tone, clarity, logic, emotional intelligence, and examples used.
Example:

"Candidate appears confident but often resorted to buzzwords instead of real examples."

5. Technical Knowledge (from Interview 2):
Example:

"Claimed Python experience, but failed to discuss any use cases or projects involving the language."
"Explained API integration decently, but lacked understanding of error handling."

6. Problem Solving / Critical Thinking (from Interview 3):
Evaluate clarity, logic, structure, realism.
Example:

"Candidate showed logical thinking in approaching product design issues, but didn’t factor in user feedback or testing."

7. Unverified Claims:
Highlight things the candidate stated with no support.

"Mentioned leading a team but offered no examples or measurable outcomes."
"Said they are proficient in Excel, but gave no scenarios or projects where it was used."

8. Communication Score: (1–10)
Based on clarity, relevance, tone, and conciseness.

9. Credibility Score: (1–10)
Reflects how well-supported their statements are.

10. Consistency Score: (1–10)
Do their answers align across all interviews?

11. Readiness for Face-to-Face:
State clearly whether the candidate seems ready to move to a face-to-face interview based on profile + interview performance. Include:

“Candidate may proceed to face-to-face, but interview should clarify areas like technical depth and project ownership.”

📌 Profile Analysis Behavior Rules
Analyze every answer critically — no surface-level restating.

Every strength must come with a "but" — balance the praise.

Every vague answer, contradiction, or unsupported claim must be called out.

If they said something good, but execution or details were weak, highlight it.

If they mentioned certifications or skills they did not show, clearly flag the need for proof.

❌ Do Not:
Do not fill in gaps with assumed skills or knowledge.

Do not offer praise for vague statements.

Do not create profiles that sound optimistic or promotional.

✅ Goal:
The profile must read like it was written by a tough, fair recruiter after an in-depth interview—not like marketing fluff. It should feel credible, nuanced, and trustworthy to anyone reviewing it.
