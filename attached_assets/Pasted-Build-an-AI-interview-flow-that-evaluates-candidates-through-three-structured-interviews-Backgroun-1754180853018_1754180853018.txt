Build an AI interview flow that evaluates candidates through three structured interviews — Background, Professional, and Technical — by intelligently analyzing their CV, manually filled profile, and previous interview answers. All insights must be used to generate a single, honest, comprehensive, and reliable final profile after all stages are complete.

🔹 Data Sources to Analyze for Each Step
For each interview and the final profile, the AI must cross-analyze the following:

✅ CV (including job titles, responsibilities, tools used, dates, education, achievements)

✅ Manually filled profile (name, role, skills, location, experience, etc.)

✅ Answers from previous interviews (each interview builds on the last)

These sources must be cross-validated. For instance, if a skill or tool is mentioned in the CV but omitted in interviews, the AI should inquire further or note the discrepancy.

🟠 1. Background Interview
Purpose: Understand the candidate’s education, work history, major achievements, motivations, and career trajectory.

What to ask:

“Walk me through your most recent role as a [title from CV/profile]. What were your daily tasks?”

“Why did you transition from [previous role] to [current role]?”

“Tell me about a time you felt proud of your work. What was the impact?”

“What prompted you to enter this field?”

“What kind of environments have you worked in — startups, corporates, freelance?”

AI must evaluate:

Timeline consistency between roles and dates

Alignment between job titles and described responsibilities

Depth of explanation and ability to reflect on growth

Storytelling clarity, engagement, and relevance

🟡 2. Professional (Soft Skills) Interview
Purpose: Assess soft skills, behavioral fit, critical thinking, communication, conflict resolution, leadership, and emotional intelligence.

What to ask:

“Tell me about a time you faced conflict in a team. How did you resolve it?”

“What’s your approach to time management in high-pressure situations?”

“Describe your leadership style. Can you give an example from your past role?”

“What kind of work culture do you thrive in?”

“Tell me about a difficult feedback you received and how you reacted.”

AI must evaluate:

Specificity vs generality in answers

Communication ability and emotional intelligence

Alignment between declared personality traits and examples

Presence or lack of leadership, collaboration, adaptability, or maturity

🔵 3. Technical Interview
Purpose: Evaluate domain expertise, technical competencies, problem-solving, familiarity with tools, certifications, and practical understanding.

What to ask (customized by role):

“Explain how you used [tool/skill from CV] in a real project.”

“What’s a recent technical challenge you faced, and how did you solve it?”

“If you were asked to do [task relevant to role], how would you approach it?”

“Which tools or technologies do you prefer, and why?”

“Tell me about your experience with certifications or learning platforms.”

AI must evaluate:

Authenticity and clarity of technical examples

Tool knowledge vs buzzword dropping

Depth of understanding vs surface-level explanations

Whether claimed certifications or skills are backed by examples or documents

If a candidate claims a certification (e.g., AWS, PMP), but there's no uploaded document, the AI should state:

“Candidate claimed to hold [certification], but verification is required.”

🔻 Interview-Wide Requirements
🔁 Review past interviews: If a detail is mentioned earlier (e.g., team size, task, conflict), later interviews should refer back and validate or expand.

🧩 Avoid redundancy: Don’t repeat questions already asked or answered clearly.

🚩 Inconsistencies: If timelines, roles, or claims differ, probe further.

🧠 Behavioral insights: Deduce personality traits (openness, leadership, detail-orientation, etc.) based on tone, structure, and reaction to questions.

📄 Final Profile (Only Generated After All 3 Interviews + Profile Completion)
This is the only profile created — one single, comprehensive, blunt and credible profile used for employer review.

Sections:
Candidate Summary

Role-focused snapshot using all validated data

Include highlights and always a “but” (e.g., “Strong project experience, but lacked detail in communication examples.”)

Soft Skills Overview

Based on professional interview + tone analysis

Mention strengths and gaps (e.g., “Good at resolving conflict, but weak leadership examples.”)

Technical Skills Evaluation

Based on technical interview + CV + certifications

“Candidate demonstrated familiarity with Python in prior roles, but failed to explain practical application clearly.”

Certifications

If claimed but unverified, note: “Mentioned [certification] with no document attached. Verification needed.”

Gaps & Concerns

List red flags, vague answers, or unsupported claims (e.g., “No clear explanation for a 2-year gap between roles.”)

Final AI Recommendation

Should the candidate be shortlisted for a face-to-face interview?

If yes: What should the employer ask to confirm or probe deeper?

Overall Score (0–100)

Based on balanced weighting from all three interviews + profile + CV consistency

⚠️ Final Notes
The AI must actively assess, not summarize blindly.

Must avoid generating vague or overly positive profiles.

No interview should proceed without fully analyzing earlier answers.

The CV must be treated as a foundation, not a separate file. If something is in the CV but not mentioned in interviews, the AI must inquire or flag it.
