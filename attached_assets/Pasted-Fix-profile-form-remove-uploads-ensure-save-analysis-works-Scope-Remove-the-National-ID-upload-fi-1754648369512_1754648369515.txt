Fix profile form: remove uploads, ensure save/analysis works
Scope

Remove the National ID upload field. Replace with manual text fields only for ID details.

Remove the Resume upload and Cover letter upload sections entirely.

Keep the Certificate upload feature, but fix it so files upload, persist to storage, and correctly associate with the user profile.

Functionality & UX

Ensure the Complete Profile button triggers validation, saves all fields, and updates the profile completion percentage accurately.

Guarantee all profile data (every field and certificate metadata) is saved reliably and is retrievable by the AI interview service.

No silent failures: show clear inline errors and blocking toasts when saves/uploads fail.

Data & Integration

Expose a stable read endpoint/service so the AI interviewer can fetch all profile text fields and certificates without missing data.

Confirm data is stored in canonical fields (no duplicates or stale caches) and that the AI receives the latest version.

Acceptance Criteria

ID is entered manually (no upload option visible).

Resume and cover letter upload components are removed in UI and code.

Certificate upload:

Accepts allowed file types and size limits.

Upload progress + success/failure states displayed.

File stored and linked to the user; record visible on refresh.

“Complete Profile”:

Becomes enabled only when required fields are valid.

Saves successfully and updates completion % immediately.

Navigates or confirms with success feedback.

AI fetch:

Single API call returns complete, current profile data (including certificates) for analysis.

Load test: 20 consecutive fetches return consistent data with 0 errors.

Test Steps

Fill all fields, upload a certificate, click Complete Profile → expect success toast and updated %.

Refresh page → all data persists; certificate link/download works.

Hit AI fetch endpoint → verify all fields and certificates are present and current.

Trigger a failed upload (oversized file) → proper error shown; no partial records created.
