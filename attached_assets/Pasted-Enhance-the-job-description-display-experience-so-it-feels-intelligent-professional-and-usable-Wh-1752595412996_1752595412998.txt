Enhance the job description display experience so it feels intelligent, professional, and usable. When a user clicks a job posting, the details should be presented in a smooth, user-friendly panel that doesn‚Äôt break the layout or hide important functions.

‚úÖ Key Instructions
Scrollable Job Details Panel

When a user clicks a job to view its full description, the content should appear in a dedicated panel or overlay.

That panel must allow the user to scroll within it if the content is too long.

Scrolling should be smooth and limited to the job description section ‚Äî it should not affect the rest of the page layout.

Maintain Full Functionality of the Main Page

The filters on the left and the list of job cards should remain fully functional when the job details panel is open.

Nothing outside the job description view should freeze or become unclickable unless this is being viewed on mobile in full screen.

Keep Job Title Visible While Scrolling

The job title (and optionally the company name or location) should stay visible at the top of the job details view as the user scrolls down.

This makes the reading experience easier and more contextual, especially for longer descriptions.

Always-Visible Apply Button

The "Apply" button should always be visible at the bottom of the job description view, no matter how much the user scrolls.

It should not require the user to reach the end of the content to apply.

This improves usability and increases the chance of application.

Smart Matching Feedback on Apply

When the user clicks ‚ÄúApply,‚Äù analyze their profile and all three completed interviews (background, professional, technical).

If they‚Äôre a strong match, provide confirmation and encourage applying.

If they are not a match, tell them clearly why they‚Äôre not a good fit, referencing missing skills, lack of experience, or mismatches with the job description.

The response should feel insightful, personalized, and professional ‚Äî not generic.

Don‚Äôt Hide Filter Options on Slight Mismatches

The filtering system should not automatically hide job options unless the mismatch is critical.

Show as many jobs as possible that could be relevant, even if not perfect, and let users explore freely with guidance, not restrictions.

üß† Experience Design Tips (Optional)
Let users close the job description panel smoothly and return to their filtered results.

Add visual cues or subtle highlights when a job is a strong match.

Use consistent spacing and clean design so the content is easy to read.

Don‚Äôt let panels feel oversized, cramped, or unbalanced. Keep the flow clean.
