I want to remove the “Upload CV” section entirely from the platform.

Instead, I want manual data entry fields to collect the CV-related information from the applicant. These fields should include (but not be limited to):

Full Name

Date of Birth

Nationality

Educational Background (Institution, Degree, Start/End Dates)

Work Experience (Company, Role, Duration, Responsibilities)

Languages

Certifications

Skills (Soft & Technical)

Preferred Work Type (Full-time, Part-time, Freelance, Internship)

Location Preferences

Career Interests

Achievements

Important requirements:

✅ Preserve Current Saving Logic:
These new fields must save data the same way existing profile fields are saved (i.e., linked to the user profile without breaking the structure or flow of existing records).
⚠️ Do not alter or interfere with the logic that controls the profile progress or the unlocking of interview stages.

🤖 AI Interview Customization Based on Manual CV:
Once the user fills out their CV manually, the AI interviews (background, professional, technical) must generate and ask targeted questions based on the manually filled data.
Example:

If someone lists “Marketing Intern at Company X,” the background interview should ask:
“Tell me more about your internship at Company X. What were your day-to-day tasks?”

If someone lists a certification in Data Analysis, the technical interview should ask:
“How did you apply the data analysis skills you learned from [Certification] in real-life situations?”

📋 Profile Generation Must Reflect All Manually Entered CV Fields:
After the interviews are done and the profile is generated, it must include both:

The manually entered CV data

The AI-analyzed insights from the interviews

🔒 Ensure Field Consistency & No Conflicts:
These added manual CV fields must:

Save to the same database structure as other profile data

Not affect the unlocking of interview stages or completion progress

Be modular and cleanly structured to prevent conflicts with future features
