Create a super smart, context-aware, and deeply personalized job discovery experience for the user. The page must behave like a real-time, intelligent career assistant — not just a static job board.

🧩 SYSTEM BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS
1. 🔍 SMART FILTER SYSTEM
✅ Filters must:
Include the following options:

Workplace: On-site, Hybrid, Remote

Country, City, Area

Career Level

Job Category

Job Type

Date Posted

Be visible and user-selectable in a left sidebar

Remain available at all times — never disappear even if no perfect matches are found

Support partial matches — allow the user to explore closely related jobs, not just exact matches

🧠 Intelligent Behavior:
If a selected filter has few or no matches:

Show related or nearby matches

Provide a small notice:

“No exact matches found. Showing related roles based on your profile.”

2. 📄 JOB CARDS DISPLAY
Each job appears as a card on the right panel with:

Job Title

Company Name and Logo

Location and Workplace Type

AI Match Score (0–100%)

Key Tags: [Full-time], [Urgent], [Internship], etc.

"View Details" or “View Job” button

3. 👁️‍🗨️ OPENING A JOB (EXPANDED VIEW)
When a user clicks a job card:

Expand or open a dedicated section/modal showing:

Full job description

Requirements

Responsibilities

Company description

“Apply” button (clearly visible)

4. ✅ APPLYING TO A JOB (SMART EVALUATION)
When the user presses “Apply”:

🔄 Match Analysis:
Run an instant analysis comparing the job's requirements to:

The user's profile data

Their answers from all three interviews

🧠 Response must include:
If the user is a strong match:

“✅ You’re a great fit for this role. Your skills and experiences align with the job requirements.”

If the user does not match well:

“⚠️ Based on your profile and interview data, you may not be the strongest fit for this role.”

❓Always provide reasons:
“Here’s why:”

Your technical experience doesn’t match the listed stack (e.g., React, Node.js)

The company requires 3+ years of experience, and your profile shows 1

You indicated in the interview that you prefer remote roles, and this job is on-site

5. 🎯 OPTIONAL: SUGGEST NEXT STEP
If the user doesn’t match well:

Offer nearby matches or similar jobs automatically

Say:

“You might still want to consider these alternatives...”

6. 💬 TONE & CLARITY
Never overly optimistic

Be direct, helpful, and professionally neutral

Keep feedback short but concrete and tied to their data

7. 📱 UI & UX Considerations
Search bar at top of job panel

Sticky sidebar with filters

Hover states on cards

Smooth transitions when opening job details

Apply confirmation modal or sidebar
